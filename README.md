## Overview üéØ
This project analyzes bank customer data to uncover insights about customer behavior, preferences, and potential risk factors. The analysis aims to assist in decision-making processes regarding customer retention strategies, risk management, and overall business growth.

The analysis was conducted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hitruonganh/customer-retention-analysis-and-prediction?scriptVersionId=194699157) using a Jupyter notebook, which can be accessed via the link provided below.

## Objective üîç
- **Understand** customer demographics and behavior.
- **Identify** key factors influencing customer decisions, such as product subscription.
- **Analyze** risk factors that could lead to customer churn.
- **Provide** actionable insights for improving customer retention and targeting.

## Dataset Description üñºÔ∏è

5. **Visualization**:
   - Created visualizations to present findings clearly.
   - Highlighted important trends and correlations.

## Model Training and Evaluation
- I will train various machine learning models to predict customer retention. I'll start with Logistics Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and later I will compare its performance with other models. Cross-validation will be used to ensure the robustness of our results.
- Please visit [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hitruonganh/customer-retention-analysis-and-prediction?scriptVersionId=194699157) for more detail.
## Key Insights
- **Customer Age and Loan Preferences**: Older customers are more likely to have housing loans, while younger customers tend to have higher account balances.
- **Impact of Campaigns**: Previous successful campaigns significantly influence customer responses in the current campaign.
- **Risk Factors**: Customers with default history and lower education levels are more prone to churn.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identified distinct customer segments that can be targeted with tailored marketing strategies.

## Conclusion
The analysis provided critical insights into customer behavior, which can be used to enhance customer engagement strategies, improve risk management, and ultimately drive business growth.
